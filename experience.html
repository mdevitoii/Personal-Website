                                I have had 2 years of programming experience in Java. The first was through a introductory Java course I took in high school, where I was introduced to the syntax and the very basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). From there, I went on to take Programming II at Messiah University, which focuses on more experienced Java and implementing more OOP practices while programming. This course is where I began my work on my scheduling manager and many other projects that can be found on my GitHub.

                                I’ve had 3 years of experience programming in Python. Like Java, I was first introduced to the language in high school, where I took a course that taught me most of what I needed to know about the language. I also took Programming I at Messiah University that focused on more advanced Python and led me to create some of my favorite programs. For example, I created an archery game using a pre-built graphics library and made it fully functional, with different modes and settings that the user can configure. I dedicated this project to my girlfriend (who loves archery), and I have published it and some of my other projects on my GitHub. I also served as the teaching assistant of the Programming I course during the Spring of 2025, where I taught students Python concepts and answered questions they brought to me through office hours.

                                I’ve had less than a year of experience programming in HTML and using CSS. Like Java and Python, I was introduced to the language in high school, but I never went in-depth or made my own website. This changed when I took Web Development: Client Side at Messiah University, where I learned the ins and outs of HTML and became more experienced with implementing CSS as well. This website serves as my personal project for the course, and I am very thankful for the opportunity to learn how to make my own website! I am looking forward to continuing my growth in web development by taking Web Development: Server Side in the Fall of 2025.

                                I’ve had less than a year of experience creating MySQL queries. I began learning MySQL syntax during my Database Concepts course in the Spring of 2025. I am confident in my ability to efficiently create SQL queries and manage tables with large amounts of information. However, I do need some more experience in terms of time spent working with SQL and other database software like MariaDB.
